# PFTC4_svalbard

This is the Github repo for the data paper: Vandvik and Halbritter et al. 2023. Plant traits and associated data from experimental warming, a bird-cliff, and an elevation gradient in Svalbard. Scientific Data.

The repository contains all the code to download the raw data, clean the data and get the clean data. The data is not on this repository, but on the OSF repository: https://osf.io/smbqh/ (for more details see the data paper).
This code also contains a quarto document that (almost) replicates the Data Record section in the data paper.

For running all the code, open the run.R file and source it.
